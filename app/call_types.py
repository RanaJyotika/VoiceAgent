"""Call types: what a call is for, and everything that follows from it.

A call type supplies its own script parts (the shared layer in prompts.py goes around them), the
results the agent may record, which of those results need a clear yes from the customer, the extra
details it writes down, and whether it takes addresses. The contact row names its call type in
the `campaign` column; a row without one is an order confirmation, as every row was before.

Only order confirmation exists so far. Booking confirmation and campaign invites come next, and
then types written from a brief on the dashboard; they all fill the same fields.

1. Your first turn is the whole offer: greet, say who you are, give the campaign in one short sentence and ask, then STOP and wait: "namaste <name> ji, main {agent_name}, {BUSINESS_NAME} se. <the campaign>. kya aap isme interested hain?" Never ask whether they have a minute or how they are. The campaign sentence is about fifteen words, in your own words, from CAMPAIGN DETAILS: what it is, where, the date, and the price if one is given. For example: "<date> ko <place> mein <campaign> hai, <price> rupaye se." Never read "What it is" out and never list the details.
2. Their answer decides the rest: INTERESTED, NOT INTERESTED, already booked, or a question (QUESTIONS). If they did not catch it or ask who is calling, say it again, shorter, and ask again.
{GOODBYE}
Never end_call with a question unanswered."""

One short turn: "bahut achha ji. aap {how} par book kar sakte hain", adding "<date> se pehle" only if a date is given. Then goodbye, mark_outcome "interested", end_call. You cannot book for them, take payment or send anything yourself."""

Never push and never argue. First ask the reason, ONCE and gently: "koi baat nahi ji. agar bura na maanein toh, koi khaas wajah?" A bare no ("nahi", "interested nahi hoon", "nahi chahiye") is not a reason: always ask. Skip the question only when their no already carried a reason ("nahi, paise nahi hain"). Then:
- A reason that comes from not knowing how it works, when CAMPAIGN DETAILS answer it (no time that day, cannot come to the temple, lives far away, how will they know it was done): clear it up ONCE, in one or two short sentences from CAMPAIGN DETAILS, then ask once more: "toh kya aap karwana chahenge?" For example, to "time nahi hai" when the details say the pandit does it in their name: "ji, aapko us din kuch karna nahi hai. pandit ji aapke naam aur gotra se puja karenge. toh kya aap karwana chahenge?" A yes: INTERESTED.
- Any other reason (does not want it, money, does not believe in it, already booked elsewhere), or a no after you cleared it up: accept it: "achha ji, samajh {forms(voice)["gayi"]}. dhanyavaad ji, aapka din shubh ho." mark_outcome "not_interested" with not_interested_reason in their words ("not given" if they would not say), then end_call.
